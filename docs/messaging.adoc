== Messaging

The export-api can listen to RabbitMQ queue (defined by property `dina.messaging.export.queue`) for object export
and report template upload notifications.

=== Object Exports

The api will download the object using the toa (temporary object access) key to store it.
The export will then appear as a data export of type `OBJECT_ARCHIVE`.

=== Report Templates

The api will download the report template using the toa (temporary object access) key to store it.
The template will then be available for a report template resource to use it.
